    <string name="product_comment_liquid_alkaline_buffer">Considerations: Liquid Alkaine Buffer raises KH in much smaller increments than Alkaline Buffer. Depending on your requirements, you may choose to use Alkaline Buffer instead. 2 meq/L is equal to  5.6 dKH. If your test kit measures in dKH, divide your test kit reading by 2.8 to determine your current KH levels in meq/L. Do the same for desired KH.</string>
